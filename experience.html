                            <p class="expDesc">In August of 2021, I accepted an internship opportunity for a small travel 
                                company in Hamburg, Germany. The position was for a software engineering
                                student with more of a focus on website design and development and was remote. They were
                                in need of a new website that would be able to catch customers' attentions
                                and to give the company a better web presence in the days of the global pandemic.
                                My tasks on this project were:
                                <ul class="expTasks">
                                    <li>Designing and Implementing UI/UX practices and creating wireframes in Adobe Photoshop
                                        and Spark.</li>
                                    <li>Programming the website from scratch using HTML and CSS. The goal was to adhere to the
                                        earlier designed wireframes I had created and presented to the company heads for acceptance.</li>
                                    <li>Developing code for the main feature of the site; a currency exchange calculator, using Javascript and CSS</li>
                                    <li>Identifying feature requirements and brainstorming solutions through standups and other meetings</li>
                                    <li>Deploying responsive design to accomodate for mobile phone users</li>
                                    <li>Troubleshooting and resolving bugs in code using Chrome developer tools</li>
                                </ul>

                                develop my skills and get me ready for my software engineering/web dev career. I am currently creating beautiful websites
                                in my free time and also learning to use a couple new frameworks and libraries like Angular and React. I also plan
                                to get AWS certifications to help me broaden my knowledge in web and computer technologies. Below are some of the companies
                                I have worked with.
